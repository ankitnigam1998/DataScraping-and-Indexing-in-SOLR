      "  Summary: ['The Great Famine Irish an Gorta Mr n t mo also known within Ireland as the Great Hunger or simply the Famine and outside Ireland as the Irish Potato Famine was a period of starvation and disease in Ireland lasting from 1845 to 1852 that constituted a historical social crisis and subsequently had a major impact on Irish society and history as a whole The most severely affected areas were in the western and southern parts of Irelandwhere the Irish language was dominantand hence the period was contemporaneously known in Irish as an Drochshaol which literally translates to the bad life and loosely translates to the hard times The worst year of the famine was 1847 which became known as Black 47 During the Great Hunger roughly 1 million people died and more than 1 million more fled the country causing the countrys population to fall by 2025 in some towns populations fell as much as 67 between 1841 and 1871 Between 1845 and 1855 at least 21 million people left Ireland primarily on packet ships but also on steamboats and barquesone of the greatest exoduses from a single island in historyThe proximate cause of the famine was the infection of potato crops by blight Phytophthora infestans  throughout Europe during the 1840s Blight infection caused 100000 deaths outside Ireland and influenced much of the unrest that culminated in European Revolutions of 1848 Longerterm reasons for the massive impact of this particular famine included the system of absentee landlordism and singlecrop dependence Initial limited but constructive government actions to alleviate famine distress were ended by a new Whig administration in London which pursued a laissezfaire economic doctrine but also because some in power believed in divine providence or that the Irish lacked moral character with aid only resuming to some degree later Large amounts of food were exported from Ireland during the famine and the refusal of London to bar such exports as had been done on previous occasions was an immediate and continuing source of controversy contributing to antiBritish sentiment and the campaign for independence Additionally the famine indirectly resulted in tens of thousands of households being evicted exacerbated by a provision forbidding access to workhouse aid while in possession of more than onequarter acre of land\\nThe famine was a defining moment in the history of Ireland which was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1801 to 1922 The famine and its effects permanently changed the islands demographic political and cultural landscape producing an estimated 2 million refugees and spurring a centurylong population decline For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora the famine entered folk memory The strained relations between many Irish and their ruling British government worsened further because of the famine heightening ethnic and sectarian tensions and boosting nationalism and republicanism both in Ireland and among Irish emigrants around the world English documentary maker John Percival said that the famine became part of the long story of betrayal and exploitation which led to the growing movement in Ireland for independence Scholar Kirby Miller makes the same point Debate exists regarding nomenclature for the event whether to use the term Famine Potato Famine or Great Hunger the last of which some believe most accurately captures the complicated history of the periodThe potato blight returned to Europe in 1879 but by this time the Land War one of the largest agrarian movements to take place in 19thcentury Europe had begun in Ireland The movement organized by the Land League continued the political campaign for the Three Fs which was issued in 1850 by the Tenant Right League during the Great Famine When the potato blight returned to Ireland in the 1879 famine the League boycotted notorious landlords and its members physically blocked the evictions of farmers the consequent reduction in homelessness and house demolition resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of deaths']\n",

      "  Title: ['Timeline of major famines in India during British rule']\n",
      "  Summary: ['The timeline of major famines in India during British rule covers major famines on the Indian subcontinent from 1765 to 1947 The famines included here occurred both in the princely states regions administered by Indian rulers British India regions administered either by the British East India Company from 1765 to 1857 or by the British Crown in the British Raj from 1858 to 1947 and Indian territories independent of British rule such as the Maratha Empire\\nThe year 1765 is chosen as the start year because that year the British East India Company after its victory in the Battle of Buxar was granted the Diwani rights to land revenue in the region of Bengal although it would not directly administer Bengal until 1784 when it was granted the Nizamat or control of law and order  The year 1947 is the year in which the British Raj was dissolved and the new successor states of Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan were established  The eastern half of the Dominion of Pakistan would become the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh in 1971\\nA major famine is defined according to a magnitude scale which is an endtoend assessment based on total excess death  According to it a a minor famine is accompanied by less than 999 excess deaths b a moderate famine by between 1000 and 9999 excess deaths c a major famine by between 10000 and 99999 excess deaths d a great famine by between 100000 and 999999 excess deaths and e a catastrophic famine by more than 1 million excess deathsThe British era is significant because during this period a very large number of famines struck India  There is a vast literature on the famines in colonial British India The mortality in these famines was excessively high and in some may have been increased by British policies The mortality in the Great Bengal famine of 1770 was between one and 10 million the Chalisa famine of 17831784 11 million Doji bara famine of 17911792 11 million and Agra famine of 18371838 800000  In the second half of the 19thcentury largescale excess mortality was caused by Upper Doab famine of 18601861 2 million Great Famine of 18761878 55 million  Indian famine of 18961897 5 million and  Indian famine of 18991900 1 million  The first major famine of the 20th century was the Bengal famine of 1943 which affected the Bengal region during wartime it was one of the major South Asian famines in which anywhere between 15 million and 3 million people died\\nThe era is significant also because it is the first period for which there is systematic documentation  Major reports such as the Report on the Upper Doab famine of 18601861 by Richard Baird Smith those of the Indian Famine Commissions of 1880 1897 and  1901 and the Famine Inquiry Commission of 1944 appeared during this period as did the Indian Famine Codes  These last consolidating in the 1880s  were the first carefully considered system for the prediction of famine and the preemptive mitigation of its impact the codes were to affect famine relief well into the 1970s The Bengal famine of 1943 the last major famine of British India occurred in part because the authorities failed to take notice of the famine codes in wartime conditions  The indignation caused by this famine accelerated the decolonization of British India  It also impelled Indian nationalists to make food security an important postindependence goal After independence the Dominion of India and thereafter the Republic of India inherited these codes which were modernized and improved and although there were severe food shortages in India after independence and malnutrition continues to the present day there were neither serious famines nor clear and undisputed or largescale ones  The economist Amartya Sen who won the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in part for his work on the economic mechanisms underlying famines has stated in his 2009 book The Idea of JusticeThough Indian democracy has many imperfections nevertheless the political incentives generated by it have been adequate to eliminate major famines right from the time of independence The last substantial famine in India  the Bengal famine  occurred only four years before the Empire ended The prevalence of famines which had been a persistent feature of the long history of the British Indian Empire ended abruptly with the establishment of a democracy after independence\\nMigration of indentured labourers from India to the British tropical colonies of Mauritius Fiji Trinidad and Tobago Surinam Natal and British Guyana has been correlated to a large number of these famines The first famine of the British period the Great Bengal famine of 1770 appears in work of the Bengali language novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee the last famine of the British period Bengal famine of 1943 appears in the work of the Indian film director Satyajit Ray The inadequate official response to the Great Famine of 18761878 led Allan Octavian Hume and William Wedderburn in 1883 to found the Indian National Congress the first nationalist movement in the British Empire in Asia and Africa Upon assumption of its leadership by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920 Congress was to secure India both independence and reconciliation']\n",

      "  Summary: ['The Holodomor also known as the Great Ukrainian Famine was a manmade famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians The Holodomor was part of the wider Soviet famine of 19301933 which affected the major grainproducing areas of the Soviet Union\\nWhile scholars are in consensus that the cause of the famine was manmade whether the Holodomor constitutes a genocide remains in dispute Some historians conclude that the famine was deliberately engineered by Joseph Stalin to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement Others suggest that the famine was primarily the consequence of rapid Soviet industrialisation and collectivization of agriculture A middle position held for example by Andrea Graziosi is that the initial causes of the famine were an unintentional byproduct of the process of collectivization but once it set in starvation was selectively weaponized and the famine was instrumentalized and amplified against Ukrainians to punish them for their rejection of the new serfdom and to break their nationalismUkraine was one of the largest grainproducing states in the USSR and was subject to unreasonably high grain quotas compared to the rest of the USSR  This caused Ukraine to be hit particularly hard by the famine Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials vary greatly A joint statement to the United Nations signed by 25 countries in 2003 declared that 710 million died However current scholarship estimates a range significantly lower with 35 to 5 million victims The famines widespread impact on Ukraine persists to this day\\nSince 2006 the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine and 33 other UN member states the European Parliament and 35 of the 50 states of the United States as a genocide against the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government']\n",
